# Clipboard Translator

Clipboard Translator is a discrete Python utility designed to help students translate text directly from their clipboard without the need to open Google Translate in a web browser. This program automates the process of fetching text from the system's clipboard, translating it into a specified language, and then updating the clipboard with the translated textâ€”all without any visible application interface. This makes it an ideal tool for environments where discreet usage of translation services is necessary.
